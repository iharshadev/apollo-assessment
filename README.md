# Apollo Back-End Engineering Challenge

This challenge is designed to evaluate several things:
 - How well you know Python
 - How effectively you can work with the Django framework
 - How well you understand different data serialization formats, which is important for working with the diverse APIs Apollo integrates with
 - Your ability to work with connected Django pages
 - Your ability to work with Django Rest Framework
 
It is intended to take 2-4 hours. After you submit your solution (either by emailing us a .tar or .zip file, or uploading to GitHub), we will schedule a call to talk through your solution and how it could be extended to accomplish further goals.
 
## Setting Up

Install Python 3.7 or later if it is not already installed. Then, set up and enter a virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies. You should then be able to run the project from the `exercise` directory by running `python manage.py runserver`.

To verify that the server is running correctly, visit `http:127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

## Challenge Guidelines

This Django project consists of two parts:
1. A very simple HTML page at `/connected/`.
2. A stubbed out API endpoint at `/api/converter/convert/`

Your tasks are to:
1. Add a file input to the HTML page and modify the view so that, when a file is submitted, convert it to JSON and return that to the user
2. Add the same functionality to the API endpoint, returning the converted JSON as an `application/json` response.

To test your solution, you can run `python manage.py test`. This will execute 3 tests, which attempt to submit a file and check the response.

A good solution will not only pass the tests, but also work on any user-submitted XML file.

### JSON Conversion

For the purposes of this exercise, you may ignore any XML attributes. We are only interested in converting the XML node tags and any text values into JSON.

Leaf nodes should be converted into a JSON object with the node tag as the key and the node's text value as the value. For example, `<Foo>Bar</Foo>` should be converted to `{"Foo": "Bar"}`.

Non-leaf nodes should be converted into a JSON object with the node name as the key and an array of the node's children as the value. For example:
```
<Foo>
    <Bar>Baz</Bar>
</Foo>
```
should be converted to
```javascript
{
    "Foo": [
        {"Bar": "Baz"}
    ]
}
```

The tests provide additional examples of more complex conversions.

<h1 align="center">Solution (Harsha's submission)</h1>
This implementation serves to supposed to be an improvement over that of the branch `xml-etree` in terms of transforming
 the XML file into a JSON object with the same structure/schema.

Loading the full contents of the entire XML file can get overwhelming on system memory as the size of the XML file grows.

One solution is to process the XML file in chunks/streams and roll this window until EOF is reached. Python's
 `xml.etree.ElementTree` offers the [Pull API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#pull-api-for-non-blocking-parsing) for the same purpose 


>TL;DR: Parsing an XML without knowing the schema in chunks i.e. using a moving window approach is incredibly difficult 
>as manipulating a nested data structure has it's shortcomings. This branch is a WIP as I am still evaluating which 
>approach works for this scenario
 
## XML Stream parsing

### The Pull API
1. Register events - start & end of tags
2. Feed data incrementally i.e. feed data as chunks read from the file in the request
3. Events are generated by the API every time it encounters an opening or a closing tag in the chunk that was fed.
    * These events can then be iterated over to form a JSON object
    
## Challenges
1. The biggest challenge with this approach is determining the schema without the full XML data. The Pull API does not 
maintain states across successive events. Therefore it's the developer's responsibility to do so. Maintaining a state 
becomes incredibly complicated as the level of nesting in the XML document increases.

2. Since the data is read in chunks, there are some very intricate edge cases to account for
    * When a start event is raised, the text in the associated `Element` could be incomplete depending on how many bytes were
    read by the parser and how large the text in the said `Element` was
    
### Comparison of approaches

Approach|Memory usage|Complexity|Flexibilty|Access to children nodes?|Schema derived?
---|---|---|---|---|---
ElementTree from string|High(entire XML file is read at once)|Linear - N (no. of leaf nodes)|Good|Yes|Yes
Pull API|Low(Part of the file is read at once)|Linear - N (no. of leaf nodes)|Poor - Need to explicitly maintain state to deduce certain conclusions|No|No
